# Section 8: Creating Basic Charts in Excel

## Creating an Excel Column Chart

- From the "Insert" tab, you can insert a column chart after you've selected a range of cells that have headers and values.

- Pie charts are NOT good for large amounts of data, but column charts are.

- When selecting the column chart, two new tabs appear in the ribbon: "Chart Design" and "Format".

<img src="Images/selectdata.png" width="400" />

- Under the "Chart Design" tab, there's an option to update or modify the data inside of the chart by selecting "Select Data" or "Switch Row/Column". When you select "Select Data", you can update what you would like to include in the chart.

- For example, if we wanted to omit a column (e.g., Feb 2023), we could select non-adjacent cells to make a new range in the "Chart data range:" entry field.

- Excel has a slight glitch, where sometimes it omits the data, but it maintains labels in the charts even after we've updated the data range. To remedy this glitch, we can select the axis that has the unwanted label, right-click and select "Format Axis...".

- We then change the "Axis Options" settings from "Automatically select based on data" to "Text axis", and this will update the chart to omit the "Feb 2023" label.

- We can also update the data range to omit rows (e.g., credit cards).

## Formatting an Excel Chart

- In the "Chart Design" tab, there are several pre-designed styles that you can apply to your chart.

- For anything you select in the chart, you can format and style it from the "Format" tab (e.g., colors, borders, etc.).

<img src="Images/dynamicupdated.png" width="400" />

- To dynamically change a field in a chart, select the field, and put the cursor in the formula entry section of the formula bar and enter the cell you want to display in this chart field.

<img src="Images/changecellname.png" width="400" />

- Then when you update that selected cell, you will see it update the chart as well.

- The chart data is also dynamic, so if you change data in the chart data range, you will see the chart update as you modify data.

<img src="Images/newcharttitle.png" width="400" />
<img src="Images/changelegend.png" width="400" />
<img src="Images/updatedlegend.png" width="400" />

- You can also add or modify elements of the chart by selecting "Add Chart Element" under the "Chart Design" tab in the ribbon.

## Moving a Chart to Another Worksheet

<img src="Images/movechart.png" width="400" />

- If we wanted to move our chart to another worksheet, we would select the chart and click "Move Chart" under the "Chart Design" tab.

<img src="Images/chartmonthlybudget.png" width="400" />

- We can create a brand new worksheet, or we can move the chart to an existing worksheet in this workbook.

<img src="Images/1200.png" width="400" />
<img src="Images/updatechartmonthlybudget.png" width="400" />

- The data in the chart is still dynamic. Because the chart data range is on a different worksheet now, if we update the data in that range on one worksheet, it will update the data in our chart on a different worksheet.

## Excel Pie Charts

- In creating an Excel chart, the 2 major tasks at hand are:

  1. Deciding what chart will best represent my data
  2. Formatting the chart

- Pie charts are best suited to a single axis of data, such as a single row (e.g., a bill) or a single column (e.g., a month).

<img src="Images/pie.png" width="400" />
<img src="Images/rent.png" width="400" />

- If we select more than a single axis of data and create a pie chart, Excel will choose the first row by default (e.g., rent) to create the pie chart.

<img src="Images/switchrow.png" width="400" />

- We can switch the axis by selecting "Switch Row/Column" under the "Chart Design" tab in the ribbon.

<img src="Images/febselectdata.png" width="400" />
<img src="Images/febselectdatarange.png" width="400" />
<img src="Images/febselectdataupdate.png" width="400" />

- To change the chart data range for a pie chart, we select "Select Data" from the "Chart Design" tab in the ribbon (similar to when we were making a column chart), and we select the new cells we want to include (e.g., bills for Feb 2023).

<img src="Images/hover.png" width="400" />
<img src="Images/outsideend.png" width="400" />

- When we hover over different slices of the pie chart, we can see more data. To add this data to the chart, we can select "Add Chart Element" under the "Chart Design" tab in the ribbon, then "Data Labels", then put it wherever you want the data to appear.

<img src="Images/formatdatalabels.png" width="400" />
<img src="Images/labeloptions.png" width="400" />

- If you want to add or replace data labels, select a data label and right-click on it and select "Format Data Labels..." then tick each data point you want to include from the "Label Options".

<img src="Images/draglabels.png" width="400" />

- You can also drag the data labels away from the pie chart and style it however you'd like.
