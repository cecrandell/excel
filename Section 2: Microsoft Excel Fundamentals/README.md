## Understanding the Workbook

- Within an Excel workbook, there's a worksheet. You can have unlimited worksheets depending on the memory of your computer.

- Inside of the worksheet, there are columns and rows. Where they intersect is a cell. Whatever cell you've selected will show up in the name box.

- Prior to 2007, the file extension was .xls, and now it's .xlsx.
